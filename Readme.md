### What I learned
The diiffernt variety of inputs & best practices along with the variety
of many events targets and use cases. Also organizing this code took some
thought. 


``` Different uses of inputs

<div class="option">
            <label>Font Weight <span class="fontweight-output">400</span></label>
            <input type="range" min="100" max="900" value="400" step="100" name="fontweight">
        </div>

        <div class="option">
            <label>Leading <span class="lineheight-output">1.5</span></label>
            <input type="range" min="0.75" max="2.5" value="1.5" name="lineheight" step=0.25>
        </div>
```

### Continued development
Using what I've learned I will do some more advanced things the next Repo commit.
